<h2>OUR SUPER-PILGRIM'S PROGRESS.</h2>

<p>The meagre and tantalizing report of Lord Northsquith's
great journey through Spain and North Africa which has
been issued through Reuter's agency has stimulated but not
allayed curiosity. It is therefore with unfeigned pleasure
that we are able to supplement this jejune summary with
some absolutely authentic details supplied us by a Levantine
detective of unimpeachable veracity who shadowed the party.</p>

<p>Of the journey through Spain he has little to say. Lord
Northsquith attended a bull-fight at Seville, at which an
extraordinary incident occurred. At the moment when the
distinguished visitor entered the ring and was taking his
seat in the Royal Box, the bull, a huge and remarkably
ferocious animal, suddenly threw up its hind legs and, after
pawing the air convulsively for a few seconds, fell dead on
the spot. No reason could be assigned for this rash act,
which caused a very painful impression, but it is a curious
fact that it synchronized exactly with the issue of the special
edition of the Seville evening <i>Tar&aacute;ntula</i>, with the placard
"Strange behaviour (<i>extravagancia</i>) of the British Prime
Minister."</p>

<p>At a subsequent interview with Count <span class="sc">Romanones</span>, Lord
Northsquith was reluctantly obliged to confirm the statement
that Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> was still under the impression
that the Spanish Alhambra was a late replica of a theatre
in London, but begged him not to attach undue importance
to the misapprehension.</p>

<p>The tour in Morocco was not attended by any specially
untoward incidents, but at Marrakesh a group of Berbers
evinced some hostility, which was promptly converted into
effusive enthusiasm on their learning that Lord Northsquith
was not of Welsh origin. Similar assurances were conveyed
to the sardine-fishers of the coast, with beneficial results.
The Pasha of Marrakesh expressed the hope that Lord
Northsquith was not disappointed with the Morocco Atlas,
and the illustrious stranger wittily rejoined, "No, but you
should see my new morocco-bound <i>Times</i> Atlas." When
the remark was translated to the Pasha he laughed very
courteously.</p>

<p>Always interested in the relics of the mighty past Lord
Northsquith made a special trip to the East Algerian Highlands
to visit Timgad, and spent several minutes in the
<i>tepidarium</i> of the Roman baths. It was understood from
the expression of his features that he was profoundly impressed
by the superiority of the arrangements over those
contemplated by the Coalition Minister of Health in the
new bath-houses to be erected in Limehouse.</p>

<p>Lastly the tour included a flying visit to Carthage. The
French arch&aelig;ologists in charge of the excavations had
recently dug up a colossal statue of <span class="sc">Hannibal</span>, and the
resemblance to Lord Northsquith was so extraordinary that
many of them were moved to transports of delight. They
were however unanimous in their conviction that the deplorable
state of the ruins was largely, if not entirely, due
to Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George's</span> ignorance of Ph&oelig;nician geography.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A Startling Disclosure.</h2>

<p class="center">From "Answers to Correspondents" in a Canadian Paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Q.&mdash;Is it not a fact, that all of Lipton's challengers were built
stronger and heavier than the American cup defenders, to enable
them to cross the Atlantic?&mdash;A. D. B., Montreal.</p>

<p>A.&mdash;Yes, they were built stronger as they had to cross the ocean
under their own steam."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Serious injuries were sustained by &mdash;&mdash;, aged 54, while assisting
in discharging cargo. Shortly before one o'clock, it is stated, a cheese
struck him and knocked him down."&mdash;<i>Provincial Paper.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We have always maintained that these dangerous creatures
should not be allowed to run loose.</p>

<h2>LITTLE BITS OF LONDON.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Houses of Parliament.</span></p>

<p>The guide-books have a good deal to
say about the Houses of Parliament,
but the people who write guide-books
never go to the really amusing places
and never know the really interesting
things. For instance they have never
yet explained what it is that the House
of Commons smells of. I do not refer
to the actual Chamber, which merely
smells like the Tube, but the lofty passages
and lobbies where the statues
are. The smell, I think, is a mixture
of cathedrals and soap. It is a baffling
but rather seductive smell, and they
tell me that the policemen miss it when
they are transferred to point-duty. Possibly
it is this smell which makes ex-Premiers
want to go back there.</p>

<p>But let us have no cheap mockery
of the Houses of Parliament, because
there is a lot to be said for them. They
are much the best houses for hide-and-seek
I know. The parts which are
dear to the public, the cathedral parts,
are no good for that, but behind them
and under them and all round them
there are miles and miles of superb
secret passages and back staircases, the
very place for a wet afternoon. They
are decorated like second-class waiting-rooms
and lead to a lot of rooms like
third-class waiting-rooms; and at every
corner there is a policeman; but this
only adds to the excitement. Besides,
at any moment you may blunder into
some very secret waiting-room labelled
"Serjeant-at-Arms."</p>

<p>If you are seen by the <span class="sc">Serjeant-at-Arms</span>
you have lost the game, and if
you are seen by a Lord of the Treasury
I gather from the policemen that you
would be put in the Tower. Or you may
start light-heartedly from the Refreshment
Department of the House of
Commons and find yourself suddenly in
the bowels of the House of Lords, probably
in the very passage to the <span class="sc">Lord
Chancellor's</span> Secretary's Room.</p>

<p>Still, there is no other way for
Private Secretaries to take exercise and
at the same time avoid their Members
without actually leaving the building,
so risks of that sort have to be faced.</p>

<p>While the Private Secretary is playing
hide-and-seek in the passages and
purlieus his Member waits for him in
the Secretaries' Room. The Secretaries'
Room is the real seat of legislation in
this country, and it is surprising that
Mr. <span class="sc">Bagehot</span> gave it no place in his
account of the Constitution. It is also
surprising, in view of its importance,
that it should be such a dismal, ill-furnished
and thoroughly mouldy room.
It is a rotten room. Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>,
when a Private Secretary, is reported
to have said of it, "In the whole course
of my political career I can recall no
case of administrative myopia at all
parallel to the folly or ineptitude which
has condemned the authors of legislation
in His Majesty's Parliament to discharge
their functions in this grotesque
travesty of a legislative chamber, this
sombre and obscure repository of
mouldering archives and forgotten records,
where the constructive statesmen
of to-morrow are expected to shape
their Utopias in an atmosphere of
disillusion and decay, in surroundings
appointed to be the shameful sepulchre
of the nostrums of the past." If that
is what Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> said, I agree with
him; if he didn't say it, I wish he had.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg 271]</span><p>The room is pitch-dark always, and
it is full of tables and tomes. The
tables are waiting-room tables and the
tomes are as Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> has described
them. It is divided into two by a swing-door.
One part is the female Private
Secretary part, the other is the male
Private Secretary part, and it is lamentable
to record that no romance has ever
occurred between a male Private Secretary
and a female one.</p>

<p>The room is plentifully supplied with
House of Commons' stationery, which
disappears at an astonishing rate. This
is because the Members come in and
remove it by the gross, knowing full
well that the <span class="sc">Serjeant-at-Arms</span> will
suspect the Private Secretaries. It is
a hard world.</p>

<p>However, this is where the Members
come to their Private Secretaries for instructions.
They come there nominally
to dictate letters to their constituents,
but really they come to be told what
amendments to move and what questions
to ask and what the Drainage
Bill is about, and whether they ought
to support the Dentist Qualification
(Ireland) (No. 2) Bill, or not. It is
awful to think that if the Private
Secretaries downed tools the whole
machinery of Parliament would stop.
No questions would be asked and no
amendments moved and no speeches
made. The Government would have
things all their own way. Unless,
of course, the Government's Private
Secretaries struck too. But of course
the Government's Private Secretaries
never would, the dirty blacklegs!</p>

<p>After the Secretaries' Room perhaps
the most interesting thing in the two
Houses is the House of Lords sitting
as the Supreme Court. Everybody
ought to see that. There is a nice old
man sitting in the middle in plain
clothes and several other nice old men
in plain clothes sitting about on the
benches, with little card-tables in front
of them. Two or three of them have
beards, which is against the best traditions
of the Law. But they are very
jolly old men, and now and then one
of them sits up and moves his lips.
You can see then that he is putting a
sly question to the barrister who is
talking at the counter, though you can't
hear anything because they all whisper.
While the barrister is answering, another
old man wakes up and puts a
sly question, so as to confuse the
barrister. That is the game. The barrister
who gets thoroughly annoyed
first loses the case.</p>

<p>They have quite enough to annoy
them already. They are all cooped up
in a minute pen about eight feet square.
There are eight of them, four K.C.'s and
four underlings. They have nowhere to
put their papers and nowhere to stretch
their legs. They sit there getting cramp,
or they stand at the counter talking to
the old men. In either position they
grow more and more annoyed. Four
of them are famous men, earning thousands
and thousands. Why do they
endure it? Because lawyers, contrary
to the common belief, are the most
long-suffering profession in the world.
That is why they are the only Trade
Union whose members have only half-an-hour
for lunch. Well, it is their
funeral; but if I were a K.C. sitting in
that pen, with the whole of the House
of Lords empty in front of me, I should
get over the counter and walk about.
Then the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span> might have
a fit; and that alone would make it
worth while.</p>

<p>The only other interesting place in the
Houses of Parliament is the Strangers'
Dining Room. This is interesting because
the Members there are all terrified
lest you should hear what they are
going to say. They never know who
may be at the next table&mdash;a journalist
or a Bolshevist or a landowner&mdash;and
they talk with one eye permanently over
their shoulder. It must be very painful.</p>

<p>But of course the best time to visit
the House is when it is not sitting, because
then, if you are lucky, you may
sit with impunity on the Front Bench
and put your feet up on the table. If
you are unlucky you will be shot at
dawn.</p>

<p>I wasn't present at the station when
Madame <span class="sc">Pavlova</span> arrived in London,
bringing with her, as I have been assured
by six different newspapers, no
fewer than three hundred and eighty-five
pieces of luggage. But I have
seen, thanks to Sir <span class="sc">J. M. Barrie</span>, the
transformation which a Russian <i>prima
ballerina</i> makes in an English country
home, so I happen to know exactly
what occurred. I think it deserves to
be recorded. Very well then.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Metropolitan railway terminus,
though you wouldn't perhaps recognise
it, because it looks a little like
the interior of a Greek cathedral and a
little like the fair at Nijni Novgorod,
and the posters have obviously been
painted by</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Wyndham Lewis</span>
<i>or somebody like that. One porter is
discovered leaning against an automatic
sweet machine designed by an
Expressionist sculptor. He is wearing
a long mole-coloured smock, and
looking with extreme disfavour at his
luggage-truck, which has somehow got
itself painted bright blue and green,
with red wheels. Music by</i> J. H.
Thomaski.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Enter L., puffing slowly, the boat-train.
The engine and carriages
resemble Early-Victorian prints.</i>
Madame <span class="sc">Pavlova</span> <i>descends, and
in a very expressive dance conveys
to the</i> Porter <i>that she has
one or two trunks in the guard's
van which she wants him to convey
to a taxicab</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Porter.</i> 'Ow many is there, lady?</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="sc">Pavlova</span> <i>pirouettes a little more
and points three hundred and
eighty-five times at the station-roof
with her right toe</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Porter.</i> Can't be done nohow.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="sc">Pavlova</span> <i>dances a dance indicative
of absolute and heartrending despair,
terminating in an appeal
to the heavens to come to her aid.
Enter R. an important-looking
personage with a long white
beard, wearing a costume which
might be, called a commissionaire's
if it wasn't so like a harlequin's.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Porter</i> (<i>impressively and with evident
relief</i>). The Stazione Maestro!</p>

<p><i>The Stazione Maestro.</i> What's all this?</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="sc">Pavlova</span> <i>dances an explanation of
the</i> impasse. <i>The</i> S.-M. <i>and the</i>
Porter <i>remove their caps and
scratch their heads solemnly, to
slow music</i>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>The S.-M.</i> (<i>after deep cogitation</i>). This
must be referred to the N.U.R.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Enter suddenly, R. and L., dancing,
the Central Executive Committee
of the N.U.R. There is
thunder and lightning.</i> <span class="sc">Pavlova</span>
<i>repeats her appeal. The</i> C.E.C.
<i>confabulate. The</i> Chairman <i>finally
announces that the thing is
entirely contrary to the principles
of their Union, and if the</i> Station-master
<i>permits it he must take
the consequences. The</i> C.E.C.
<i>disappear</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The S.-M.</i> What about it, Bill?</p>

<p><i>Porter.</i> We'll do it. (<i>He dances.</i>)
Here goes, Mum.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Enter, suddenly, chorus of porters
with multi-coloured trucks. (They
are the same as the</i> C.E.C. <i>really,
but they have changed their
clothes.) Aided by the</i> S.-M. <i>and</i>
Bill <i>they remove the three hundred
and eighty-five packages,
and wheel them, walking on their
toes, to the station exit, R. Here
is seen a taxicab whose driver is
wrapped in profound meditation
and smoking a hookah, the bowl
of which rests on the pavement.
It is represented to him that a
lady with some luggage desires to
charter his conveyance and proceed
to Hampstead. He comes forward
to the centre and explains:</i></p>

<p><i>1. That it is near the dinner-hour.</i></p>

<p><i>2. That he has no petrol.</i></p>

<p><i>3. That he wouldn't do it for</i>
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> <i>hisself</i>.</p>

<p><i>He retires to his vehicle and resumes
his hookah.</i> <span class="sc">Pavlova</span>
<i>dances some dances expressive of
Spring, of Butterflies, of Flowers,
of Unlimited Gold. In the midst
of the final passage the driver
leaps from his seat, rushes on to
the platform, jumps three hundred
and eighty-five times into
the air, whirls</i> <span class="sc">Pavlova</span> <i>off her
toes and dashes from side to side,
carrying her in one hand. He
finally flings her into the taxicab
and returns to his seat. The luggage
is piled upon the roof by
dancing porters and tied with
many-coloured ribbons. The taxi
departs in a cloud of petrol, the
driver steering with his toes and
manipulating the clutches with
his hands. Farewells are waved
and finally, surrounded by the
rest of the porters, the</i> Station
Master <i>and</i> Bill <i>dance a dance
of Glad Sacrifice, stab themselves
with their hands, and die</i>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>PEACE WITH HONOUR.</h2>

<p>This is the story of Mr. Holmes, the
Curate, and of how he brought peace
to our troubled house. The principal
characters are John, my brother-in-law,
and Margery, my unmarried sister, and,
at the bottom of the programme, in large
letters, Mr. Holmes, the Curate. I have
a small walking-on part. The story
will now commence.</p>

<p>John and Margery went out for a
walk in the beautiful Spring sunshine
as friendly as friendly. They came back
three hours later&mdash;well, Cecilia (his
wife) and I heard them at least two
villages away.</p>

<p>They both rushed into the room
covered with mud and shouting at the
tops of their voices.</p>

<p>"Cecilia," roared
John, "order this girl
out of my house. She
shan't stay under my
roof another hour."</p>

<p>"Cecilia," shrieked
Margery, "he's an
obstinate ignorant
wretch, and thank
Heaven he isn't <i>my</i>
husband."</p>

<p>I put a cushion over
my head.</p>

<p>Cecilia kept hers.</p>

<p>"If you will both go
out of the room," she
said, "take off your
filthy boots and come
back in your right
minds and decent
clothing I'll try to understand
what you are
both talking about."</p>

<p>They crawled out of
the room abjectly and I came out into
the open once more.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! What a family to be
in!" I said.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Cecilia," said John at tea, "harking
back to the question of Hairy
Bittercress&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hazel Catkin," said Margery.</p>

<p>"What on earth&mdash;&mdash;?" began Cecilia.</p>

<p>"I'll tell her," said Margery quickly.
"Cecilia, we had a competition this
afternoon, seeing who could find most
signs of Spring. Well, I found a bit of
Hazel Catkin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hairy Bittercress," said John.</p>

<p>"I tell you&mdash;&mdash;" went on Margery.</p>

<p>"If you will calm yourself," interrupted
John with dignity, "we will
discuss the point."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to discuss. What
do you know about botany, I'd like to
know?"</p>

<p>"My dear child," said John, "when
you were an infant-in-arms, nay,
before you existed at all, it was my
custom to ramble o'er the dewy meads,
plucking the nimble Nipplewort and
the shy Speedwell. I breakfasted on
botany."</p>

<p>"Talking of botany," I broke in
"there was a chap in my platoon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>John groaned loudly.</p>

<p>"Do you suggest," I asked, "that he
was not in my platoon?"</p>

<p>"I suggest nothing," he answered;
"I only know that they can't all have
been in your platoon."</p>

<p>"All who, John?" asked Cecilia.</p>

<p>"All the chaps he tells us about.
Haven't you noticed, since he came
home, it's impossible to mention any
type or freak or extraordinary individual
that wasn't like somebody in
his platoon? It must have been about
five thousand per cent. over strength."</p>

<p>"I treat your insults with contempt,"
I said, "and proceed with my story.
This chap had the same affliction that
has taken Margery and yourself. He
spent his life searching for specimens
of the Bingle-weed and the five-leaved
Funglebid. At bayonet-drill he would
stop in the middle of a 'long-point, short-point,
jab' to pluck a sudden Oojah-berry
that caught his eye. In the end his
passion got him to Blighty."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Margery.</p>

<p>"Well," I continued, "it was the
morning of the great German attack.
My friend&mdash;er&mdash;I will call him X&mdash;and
myself were retiring on the village of&mdash;er&mdash;Y,
followed by about six million
Germans. Shots were falling all round
us, when suddenly X saw a small wild
flower at his feet. He bent down to
pick it up and&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is quite enough, Alan," said
Cecilia.</p>

<p>"That is all, Cecilia," I said; "that
is how he got to Blighty."</p>

<p>"We will now proceed with the subject
in hand," said John after a moment's
silence. He produced a small
crushed piece of green-stuff from his
pocket.</p>

<p>"The question before the house is,
as we used to say in the Great War,
'<i>Qu'est-ce-que c'est que ceci?</i>' Any
suggestions that it is of the Lemon
species will be returned unanswered.
For my part I say it is Hairy Bittercress."</p>

<p>"And I say it's Hazel Catkin," said
Margery.</p>

<p>"And what says Hubert the herbalist?"
asked John, handing the weed
to me.</p>

<p>I examined it carefully
through the ring
of my napkin.</p>

<p>"Well," I said,
"speaking largely, I
should say it is either
Mustard or Cress, or
both as the case may
be."</p>

<p>I was howled down
and retired.</p>

<hr />

<p>We heard lots of
the weed during the
next few days. Each
morning at breakfast
it sprouted forth as it
were.</p>

<p>"And how is the
Great Unknown?" I
would ask.</p>

<p>"The Hairy Bittercress
is thriving, we
thank you," John
would answer.</p>

<p>"Hazel Catkin," Margery would
throw out.</p>

<p>"Catkin yourself," from John, and
so on <i>ad lib</i>.</p>

<p>They kept it carefully in a small pot
in the window, and if one looked at it
the other watched jealously for foul
play.</p>

<p>"On Saturday," said John, "the
Curate is coming to tea. He is a man
of wisdom and a botanist to boot&mdash;or
do I mean withal? On Saturday the
Hairy Bittercress shall be publicly proclaimed
by its rightful name."</p>

<p>"Which is Hazel Catkin," said Margery.</p>

<p>Saturday came and Saturday afternoon,
and, about three o'clock, the
Curate. I saw him coming and met
him at the door.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Holmes," I
said. "You come to a house of bitterness
and strife. Walk right in."</p>

<p>"Indeed I trust not," he said.</p>

<p>"Come with me," I replied; "I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg 275]</span>tell you all about it." And I led him
on tip-toe to a quiet spot.</p>

<p>"Mr. Holmes," I said, "you know
the family well. We have always been
a happy loving crowd, have we not?"</p>

<p>"Indeed you have," he said politely.</p>

<p>"Well," I continued, "a weed has
split us asunder. My brother-in-law
and my younger sister are on the point
of committing mutual murder."</p>

<p>I explained the whole situation and
drew a harrowing picture of its effect
on our family life. "Unless you help
us," I said, "this Hazel Catkin or Hairy
Bittercress will ruin at least four promising
young lives."</p>

<p>"But I hardly see how I am to&mdash;&mdash;"
began Mr. Holmes.</p>

<p>I told him what to do.</p>

<p>"But surely," he said, "they will
know better than that."</p>

<p>"No, they won't," I said. "Neither
of them knows anything about it, really.
Come, Mr. Holmes, it is for a good
cause."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "Perhaps the
end justifies the means. We will see
what we can do."</p>

<p>"Good man," I said. "Children unborn
will bless your name for this day's
work."</p>

<p>I took him to the dining-room, where
Margery and John were sitting.</p>

<p>"Here is Mr. Holmes," I said.</p>

<p>They both made a dash at him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Holmes," said John, "we seek
your aid. You have a wide and deep
knowledge of geography&mdash;that is
botany, and you shall settle a problem
that is ruining my home."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will do my best," said
Mr. Holmes. And then without a blush:
"What is the problem, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"We have found a piece of&mdash;&mdash;"
began John.</p>

<p>"Don't tell him," shrieked Margery.
"Let him see for himself."</p>

<p>They fetched the weed and handed it
reverently to the Curate.</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes looked at it carefully.
He breathed on it and moistened it with
his finger. At last he looked up.</p>

<p>"This is a very rare specimen indeed,"
he said; "I never remember to have
seen one quite like it. It is in fact a
hybrid." He stopped and beamed at us.</p>

<p>"What's it <i>called</i>?" shrieked Margery
and John together.</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes chose his words carefully.</p>

<p>"It is called," he said, "Hairy Catkin."</p>

<p>There was a pause while Margery
and John gazed at each other.</p>

<p>"'Hairy Catkin,'" said John solemnly.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then we're both right!" said
Margery.</p>

<p>They looked at each other again and
then did the only thing possible in the
circumstances. Each fell on the other's
neck.</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes and I shook hands
silently.</p>

<h2>CHIPPO'S SCENARIO.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With the British Army in France.</i>)</p>

<p>It was the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Grand Guignol de
Cin&eacute;ma's busy day. On the beach at
Petiteville cameras were rattling away
like machine guns, orders from the
producer were hissing through the air
with the vicious hum of explosive
bullets, and weary supers were marching
and counter-marching in a state of
hopeless apathy.</p>

<p>At the very height of these operations
Chippo Munks wandered into the camera
barrage and got firmly entangled in
the picture. As "crowd in background"
was indicated by the scenario, the
producer refrained from killing Chippo
out of hand&mdash;in fact he invited his co-operation
for another crowd a little
later on. Thus it was that Chippo
earned the right to describe himself as
a "fillum actor," with licence to speak
familiarly of his colleagues, <span class="sc">Charles
Chaplin</span> and <span class="sc">Mary Pickford</span>, and full
powers to pose as the ultimate authority
of the camp whenever cinemas
were mentioned.</p>

<p>At the Caf&eacute; des Promeneurs it was
generally assumed that Chippo was
merely waiting for a fat contract from
the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Grand Guignol, and pending
its arrival he explained that he was
constructing a suitable scenario.</p>

<p>"The public," he said, "is fed up
with Texas rancheros in Anzac 'ats and
antimacassar trousers playing poker
dice with one 'and and keeping a sustained
burst of rapid fire against their
opponents with the other. They wants
something true to life. Now, my fillum
opens at the Caf&eacute; de l'Avenir, where a
stout old British soldier runs a Crown
an' Anchor board at personal loss, but
'appy in the knowledge that 'e is
amusing his comrades."</p>

<p>"The same answering to the name of
Chippo Munks?" interjected Chris
Jones.</p>

<p>"The name on the programme is
<i>Reginald Denvers</i>," said Chippo firmly.
"Acrost the way, at the Caf&eacute; de la
Vache Noire, a drunken unprincipled
gambler named <i>Jim Blaney</i>&mdash;which
you will also reckernise is an alias&mdash;regularly
pockets the pay of 'is fellow-soldiers
under pretence of a square deal
at banker an' pontoon. One night,
'aving sucked 'is victims dry for the time
being and also largely taken 'is cawfee
<i>avec</i>, <i>Blaney</i> goes acrost to the Avenir
an' sets 'is stall out there. <i>Reginald</i>
remonstrates.</p>

<p>"'I'm the Great White Chief in this
'ostelry,' says he, 'an' we don't want no
three-card-trick sharks butting in.'</p>

<p>"'My modest shrinking vi'let,' says
<i>Blaney</i>, 'I'll play where I blinking
well please.'</p>

<p>"<i>Reginald</i> thereupon remarks that
sooner than allow 'is innocent patrons
to be swindled by a six-fingered thimblerigging
son of a confidence trickster
'e'd start in an' expose 'im.</p>

<p>"At this point <i>Blaney</i> swears to be
revenged, an' there is a hinterval of
a minute while the next part of the
fillum is bein' prepared.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span><div class="figright" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/277.png"><img width="100%" src="images/277.png" alt="" /></a><h3>A LEVY ON PATRIOTISM.</h3></div>

<p>"The following scene shows <i>Blaney</i>
all poshed up and busy trying to worm
'is way into the confidence of <i>Suzanne</i>
(the daughter of the <i>patron</i> of the Caf&eacute;
de l'Avenir), who cherishes a secret
passion for <i>Reginald</i>. 'E kids 'er to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span>drop the contents of a white packet into
<i>Reginald's vang blanc</i>, telling her it's a
love lotion&mdash;I should say potion&mdash;that
will gain 'er <i>Reginald's</i> everlasting
affections. <i>Reggie</i>, being thirsty, scoffs
off the whole issue an' finds to his dismay
that 'is voice 'as been completely
destroyed. That's a thrilling situation,
Chris, a <i>professeur de</i> Crown an' Anchor
not being able to do his patter."</p>

<p>"'E might as well shut up shop
right away," agreed Chris.</p>

<p>"Jest so. <i>Reginald</i> rushes after
<i>Blaney</i> and tells him off good an'
proper&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Ow could 'e when 'e'd lorst his
voice?" asked Chris.</p>

<p>"Oh! burn it. This is a fillum
drama. 'E sees 'is extensive <i>client&egrave;le</i>
drifting away to the Vache Noire an'
<i>Blaney</i> getting so rich 'e can afford
Beaune an' eggs an' chips for 'is supper
every night. In the interests of the
misguided victims <i>Reginald</i> tells the
Military Police that drinking goes on
during prohibited hours at the Vache
Noire, an' gets the place put out of
bounds. All the speckerlaters thereupon
return to the Avenir, an' Part II.
finishes with <i>Reginald</i> recovering 'is
voice an' carolling 'Little Billy Fair-play,
all the way from 'Olloway' while
he rakes in the shekels with both hands
and feet."</p>

<p>"I'm getting the 'ang of this a bit,"
said Chris; "I recollect there was a
chap named Slaney as once did you
down on a deal, an' I remember a red-'aired
girl at the Avenir. But all this
talk about love lotions and voice dope
gets me guessing."</p>

<p>"A fillum drama that's true to life
ain't bound to be absolutely true as to
facts. The trimmings is extra. We
opens next with a little slow music an'
<i>Jim Blaney</i> meeting <i>Reginald</i> an'
telling 'im 'e 's reformed an' given up
gambling. Instead 'e's running a very
respectable football sweep, the prize to
be given to the one as draws the team
that scores most goals, an' 'e offers
<i>Reginald</i> a commission an' a seat on
the drawing committee if he'll recommend
it amongst 'is clients. Such is
'is plausibleness that 'e even sells
<i>Suzanne</i> a ticket, though she's not
rightly sure if Aston Villa is a race-horse
or a lottery number. <i>Reginald</i>,
however, suspects treachery.</p>

<p>"'Take your breath reg'ler,' 'e says,
or makes movements to that effect.
'The matches for this sweep is played
on Saturday, an' I seems to recollect
that you an' a lot of the crowd is due for
demob on Wednesday, an' I'm going
for leave on Tuesday. What guarantee
'ave we that you weigh out before
you go?'</p>

<p>"'I pays out <i>imm&eacute;diatemong</i> on receipt
of the Sunday papers, which will
be Sunday night," says <i>Blaney</i>. 'That's
good enough, ain't it?'</p>

<p>"<i>Reginald</i> therefore invests an' participates
in the drawing, though still a
bit doubtful. 'Is fears is justified, for
on Friday night, 'aving got all the
money, <i>Blaney</i> steps outside the <i>estaminay</i>
an' hits a Military Police over the
ear."</p>

<p>"Whatever for?" asked Chris. "The
War's over."</p>

<p>"That's a mystery; but the mystery
is solved when they 'ear that <i>Blaney</i>
'as gone to clink to do ten days F.P.
No. 2.</p>

<p>"''E's just gauged it to a nicety,'
says someone; ''e won't come out till
we're demobbed, an' 'e'll be orf before
<i>Reginald</i> gets back from leave.'</p>

<p>"It's 'ere the finest scene in the
fillum ought to 'appen. Imagine a
crowd of defrauded an' infuriated soldiery,
led by <i>Reginald</i>, marching up to
the F.P. compound and demanding that
the miserable <i>Blaney</i> an' their stakes
should be 'anded over to them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:70%;"><a href="images/278.png"><img width="100%" src="images/278.png" alt="" /></a><p class="center"><i>Mabel</i> (<i>to dentist</i>). "<span class="sc">Be careful, won't you? I'm dreffly ticklish.</span>"</p></div>

<p>"'Never!' says the Provost-Sergeant,
twirling his moustaches to needle
points.</p>

<p>"'As a sportsman I appeal to you,'
says <i>Reginald</i>, 'or we'll wreck the
blinkin' compound.'</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span><p>"'I'll not give him up while I have
breath in my body,' says the Provost-Sergeant.
'I've drawn Chelsea in the
sweep.'</p>

<p>"Then should ensue the gloriousest
shemozzle that ever was; but this scene
is spoiled by some miserable perisher
who says it ain't worth while making a
rough house till they know who's won.
What really happens is that they wait
till the Sunday papers arrive, when it
is found <i>Suzanne</i> 'as won the sweep,
'er 'aving drawn Sunderland, what was
top-scorer with seven goals.</p>

<p>"It is then that <i>Reginald's</i> noble
nature shows itself. Instead of telling
'er that she's won an' then disappointing
'er by saying the prize money
is in custody, 'e buys 'er ticket for 'alf-price.
Then 'e goes to the compound
an' bribes the sentry to let 'im talk to
<i>Blaney</i> through the barbed wire.</p>

<p>"'There's the winning ticket,
<i>Blaney</i>,' 'e says; 'now pay out.'</p>

<p>"'Pay out?' says <i>Blaney</i>, grinning
hideously. 'Why, what do you think I
got into clink for?'</p>

<p>"And the end comes with <i>Reginald</i>
stalking 'elplessly outside the wire, an'
<i>Blaney</i> laughing an' taunting 'im from
inside."</p>

<p>"I don't think much of it," said
Chris critically. "I know that Slaney&mdash;'im
what you call <i>Blaney</i>&mdash;did actually
do you down real proper, but as a
fillum it ain't a good ending."</p>

<p>"P'r'aps it ain't&mdash;as it stands,"
admitted Chippo, "but when I'm demobilized&mdash;when
<i>Reginald</i> is demobilized,
I should say, an' 'e 'appens to
meet that <i>Jim Blaney</i> there'll be the
finest fillum finish that's ever been released,
if the police don't interfere."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Shortage of Straw.</span></p>

<p>Aitchkin has been doing great things
in forage, but prosperity has not spoilt
him. Although he must be aware that
I remember him in pre-war days, when
he used to strap-hang to the City with
his lunch in a satchel, nevertheless he
often invites me round on those rare occasions
when he dines quietly at home.</p>

<p>The other evening, as he toyed with
a modest eight-course dinner, I perceived
that his cheerfulness was a trifle
forced, and I thought that probably he
was worrying over the behaviour of his
little son, who, tiring that afternoon of
his motor scooter, had done incalculable
damage to the orchid-house with a
home-made catapult.</p>

<p>When we were left alone with our
cigars he unburdened his soul. It
appears that, ever since the Armistice,
ambition has spurred Aitchkin to be
something more than the "&amp; Co." of a
firm which has become torpid with war
profits. He had decided to start in
business "on his lonesome," and to
make "Aitchkin" and "forage" synonymous
terms. Already he had taken
over the premises of a sovereign purse-maker
at a "reasonable figure." (When
Aitchkin is "reasonable" somebody
loses money.) But his bargain did not
include a Telegraphic Address, and that
morning, working from his letter-heading,
"Alfred Aitchkin," he had brought
himself to compose an appropriate
word. To the "Alf" of the Christian
name he added "Alpha" representing
the initial of the surname (I suspected
the assistance of his lady-typist), making
the complete word "Alf-Alpha" or,
written phonetically, "Alfalfa"&mdash;Spanish
for lucerne. It was a word which
could not fail to fix itself indelibly in
the minds of his clients, for it recalled
not only Aitchkin's name, but the commodity
he dealt in. Full of the pride
of authorship he had driven round to the
G.P.O. in his touring car.</p>

<p>"But they crabbed it at once," he
said sadly. "Telegraphic addresses
nowadays have to conform to a lot of
rotten new rules."</p>

<p>He handed me a slip of paper on
which, over the dead body of "Alfalfa,"
he had jotted down the following
notes:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Not less than eight, not more
than ten letters.</p>

<p>(2) Must not be composed of words
or parts of words.</p>

<p>(3) Words or parts of words may be
accepted if they appear in the middle.</p>

<p>(4) Must not look like a word.</p>

<p>(5) Must be pronounceable.</p>

<p>(6) Russian names, on account of
their unusual spelling might be accepted.</p>

<p>"And what's more," Aitchkin continued,
"even when you've got a word
which the Department will accept, it
has to be submitted to a Committee
who take 'ten to fourteen days' to
make up their minds."</p>

<p>A faint tinkling of the piano came to
our ears. Mrs. Aitchkin was waiting
to sing to us. I produced pencil and
paper and threw myself heart and soul
into Aitchkin's problem.</p>

<p>"Rules 2 and 3 are a little contradictory,"
I said, "and it will require no
slight ingenuity to form a combination
of letters which shall be pronounceable
(Rule 5) and yet avoid the damnable
appearance of a word (Rule 4). The concession
about Russian names reminds
me of something I have read about
shaking hands with murder. In any
case it is a barren concession, because,
as we have seen, telegraphic addresses
must be pronounceable. There is something
sinister here," I continued. "This
is the work of no ordinary mind. Some
legal brain is behind all this."</p>

<p>Love of the bizarre and the latitude
of the Russian Rule led me to make
my first attempt with the name of that
all-round Bolshevik sportsman, <span class="sc">Blodnjinkoff</span>,
and I was endeavouring to
abridge it to not less than eight and not
more than ten letters without spoiling
the natural beauty of the name when
Aitchkin stopped me rather brusquely.
And my next effort, "<span class="sc">Plucr&oelig;s</span>," he
quashed, because he said that the implacable
suspicion of the G.P.O. would
be at once aroused by the diphthong. I
fancy, though, from the narrowing of
his eyes that he had some misgivings
as to the derivation of the word.</p>

<p>I then set to work with alternate
consonants and vowels (which must
give a pronounceable word), dealing
with difficulties under the other rules
as they might arise. Meanwhile Aitchkin,
after the manner of an obstructionist
official of the worst type, sat
over me with the rules, condemning my
results. Even "Telegrams: <span class="sc">Hahahahaha</span>
London," merely caused him to
sniff contemptuously.</p>

<p>"You'll like this one," I exclaimed&mdash;"<span class="sc">Arleyota</span>.
This is a combination of
the word 'barley' (the 'b' being
treated as obsolete like the 'n' in
'norange') and the word 'oat' with
the 'a' and 't' transposed."</p>

<p>Aitchkin was interested. Breathing
heavily, he tested the word with each
rule in turn, while I sat relaxed in my
chair. I pictured <span class="sc">Arleyota</span> passed by
the Department and brought into a
hushed chamber before a solemn conclave
of experts. How they would
probe and analyse it during those
momentous ten to fourteen days. And
what a sensation there would be when
they discovered that <span class="sc">Arleyota</span> begins
and ends with the indefinite article.</p>

<p>Aitchkin thrust the papers into his
pocket and rose abruptly, jamming the
stopper more tightly into a decanter
with his podgy hand.</p>

<p>"Not too bad, <span class="sc">Arleyota</span>," he said
loftily; "I'll get them to polish it up
at the office to-morrow." (So I <i>was</i>
right about the lady-typist).</p>

<p>He opened the door and we passed
out.</p>

<p>"But it ends in <span class="sc">TA</span>," he shouted
against the <i>Roses of Picardy</i> which
now came with unbroken force from
the drawing-room. "'<span class="sc">Ta</span>' is a word,
you know."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> may use it as such," I bawled,
"but they've never heard of it among
the staff of the G.P.O."</p>

<p>Once again we are "for it." It is
that heavy hour between five and six
when the vitality is all too low for
the ordeal that awaits us. On either
side the far-flung battle line of clustering
figures stretches away into the
gloom. It is an inspiring sight, this
tense silent crowd of men of every
class and vocation, united by a common
purpose, grimly awaiting the
moment when as one man
they will hurl themselves into
the fray.</p>

<p>Is it the mere lust for fighting
that has brought them
here? Or is it the thought
of the home that each hopes
to return to that steels their
courage and lends that <i>&eacute;lan</i>
to their resolution without
which one enters the struggle
in vain?</p>

<p>In the dim half-light I
furtively scan the set faces
around me and find myself
wondering what thoughts
those impassive masks conceal.
Are they counting the
cost? Most of them have
been through the ordeal before.
Pale faces there are&mdash;small
wonder when one
thinks of what lies before
them. Here and there a man
is puffing at his beloved "gasper"
with the nonchalance
that marks your bull-dog breed
when stern work is afoot.</p>

<p>Yet one cannot keep one's
thoughts from the tremendous
possibilities of the next
few minutes. Where shall
we be a few minutes hence?
Some, one knows, will have
gone West&mdash;and the others?
Would they effect a lodgement,
or be hurled back baffled
and raging and impotent,
as, alas! had too often been
the case before?</p>

<p>And what of those who
were even now maybe preparing
against our onslaught? Their
intelligence could hardly have failed
to warn them of our intentions. The
position would be occupied, never fear,
and in force, with seasoned men from
the East.</p>

<p>At last a stunning roar that seems
to shake the very ground, rising to a
shriek. Now it is each man for himself.
The long line surges forward,
looking eagerly for a breach. Now we
can see our opponents&mdash;hate in their
eyes&mdash;as they brace themselves for the
shock. Now we are into them, fighting
silently, with a sort of cold fury save
where a muttered curse or the sharp
cry of the injured bears testimony to
the fierceness of the struggle.</p>

<p>But see, they turn and waver. One
more rush and we are through, driving
them before us. The position is
won.</p>

<p>Breathing hard we look around at
the havoc we have wrought, and suddenly
the glamour of victory seems to
fade and one loathes the whole senseless,
savage business. We do not really
hate these men. After all, they are our
fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>But what would you? One cannot
spend the night on Charing Cross
District platform.</p>

<h2>BY THE STREAM.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Featuring the Premier.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> has returned
from a visit to the haunts of his youth
with renewed health and reinforced
Welsh accent. The last day of his
holiday was spent in fishing in the
company of two friends; but unfortunately
the newspapers failed to supply
any details of the scene, a lack of enterprise
which it is difficult to
understand, especially on the
part of the journals known
to employ Rubicon experts
on their staff. Happily we
are able to give information
which we have reason to
believe will not be officially
contradicted.</p>

<p>From his childhood Mr.
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> has known
intimately the romantic
stream, named, for some unexplained
reason, the Dwyfor
river. To its musical murmur
may be traced the
mellifluous cadences of the
statesman's voice employed
so effectually in his appeals
to Labour and the Paris
Conference. Who can say
what influences this little
Welsh river, with its bubbling
merriment, the flashing forceful
leap of its cascades, its
adroit avoidance of obstacles,
may have had upon the career
of the statesman of to-day,
as through the years it has
wound its way from the
springs to the ocean? The
senior fish of the Dwyfor are
well known to him, and they
gather fearlessly in large numbers
to smile at his bait and to
point it out to their friends.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day
a humorous incident occurred.
A keeper appeared on the opposite
bank of the river and
excitedly warned the party
that they were trespassing,
requesting them to retire.
To his amazement his demands were
ignored, and the trespassers replied to
his protests by singing "The Land
Song," the <span class="sc">Premier's</span> rich tenor voice
being easily distinguished above the
roar of a neighbouring cascade.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>Inevitably you will find a sad significance in the title of
<i>Harvest</i> (<span class="sc">Collins</span>), the last story, I suppose, that we shall
have from the pen of Mrs. <span class="sc">Humphrey Ward</span>. It is a quite
simple tale, very simply told, and of worth less for its inherent
drama than for the admirable picture it gives of rural
England in the last greatest days of the Great War. How
quick was the writer's sympathy with every phase of the
national ordeal is proved again by a score of vivid passages
in which the fortunes of her characters are dated by the
tremendous events that form their background. The story
itself is of two women in partnership on a Midland farm, one
of whom, the senior, has in her past certain secret episodes
which, as is the way of such things, return to find her out
and bring her happiness to ruin. The character of this
<i>Janet</i> is well and vigorously drawn, though there is perhaps
little in her personality as shown here to make understandable
the passion of her past. All the details of life on the
land in the autumn of 1918 are given with a skill that
brings into the book not only the scent of the wheat-field
but the stress, emotional and economic, of those unforgettable
months. Because it is all so typically English one
may call it a true consummation of the work of one who
loved England well. In Mrs. <span class="sc">Ward's</span> death the world of
letters mourns the loss of a writer whose talent was ever
ungrudgingly at the service of her country. She leaves a
gap that it will be hard to fill.</p>

<hr />

<p>In some ways I think that they will be fortunate who do
not read <i>A Remedy Against Sin</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>) till the
vicissitudes of book-life have deprived it of its pictorial
wrapper, because, though highly attractive as a drawing,
the very charmingly-clad minx of the illustration is hardly
a figure to increase one's sympathy with her as an injured
heroine. And of course it is precisely this sympathy that
Mr. <span class="sc">W. B. Maxwell</span> is playing for&mdash;first, last and all the
time. His title and the puff's preliminary will doubtless
have given you the aim of the story, "to influence the public
mind on one of the most vital questions of the day," the
injustice of our divorce laws. For this end Mr. <span class="sc">Maxwell</span>
has exercised all his ability on the picture of a foolish young
wife, chained to a lout who is shown passing swiftly from
worse to unbearable, and herself broken at last by the
ordeal of the witness-box in a "defended action." Inevitably
such a book, a record of disillusion and increasing misery,
can hardly be cheerful; tales with a purpose seldom are.
But the poignant humanity of it will hold your sympathy
throughout. You may think that Mr. <span class="sc">Maxwell</span> too obviously
loads his dice, and be aware also that (like others of
its kind) the story suffers from over-concentration on a
single theme. It moves in a world of incompatibles. The
heroine's kindly friend is tied to a dipsomaniac wife; her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg 285]</span>coachman has no remedy for a ruined home because of the
expense of divorce, and so on. To a great extent, however,
Mr. <span class="sc">Maxwell's</span> craft has enabled him to overcome even
these obstacles; his characters, though you may suspect
manipulation, remain true types of their rather tiresome
kind, and the result is a book that, though depressing,
refuses to be put down. But as a wedding-present&mdash;no!</p>

<hr />

<p><i>The Underworld</i> (<span class="sc">Jenkins</span>) describes life round about and
down below a small coal-mine in Scotland something near
thirty years ago. Its author, <span class="sc">James Welsh</span>, tells us in a
simple manly preface that he became a miner at the age
of twelve, and worked at every phase of coal-getting till
lately he was appointed check-weigher by his fellows, and
therefore writes of what he knows at first hand. Here
then is a straightforward tale with for hero a sensitive and
enthusiastic young miner who draws his inspiration from
<span class="sc">Bob Smillie</span>, loses his girl to the coal-owner's son and his
life in a rescue-party. The villain, double-dyed, is not the
coal-owner but his "gaffer," who favours his men as to
choice of position at
the coal-face in return
for favours received
from their wives. The
chief surprise to the
reader will be the difference
between the status
and power of the miner
then and now. The
writer has a considerable
skill in composing
effective dialogue, especially
between his
men; gives a convincing
picture of the pit
and home life, the
anxieties, courage, affections
and aspirations
of the friends of whom
he is "so proud." Nor
does he cover up their
weaknesses. Purple
passages of fine writing
show his inexperience
slipping into pitfalls by the way, but his work rings true
and deserves to be read by many at the present time when
miners are so far from being victims of "the block"&mdash;the
employers' device for starving out a "difficult" man&mdash;that
they look like fitting the boot to another leg. One is made
to realise their anxiety to get rid of that boot.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>How They Did It</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>) may be regarded as a novel
with a purpose, and, like most such, suffers from the defects
of its good intentions. The object is "an exposure of war
muddling at home," and it must be admitted that Mr.
<span class="sc">Gerald O'Donovan</span> gives us no half-measure; indeed I
was left with the idea that greater moderation would have
made a better case. To illustrate it, he takes his hero,
<i>David Grant</i>, through a variety of experiences. Incapacitated
from active fighting through the loss of an arm, he is
given work as a housing officer on the Home Front. His endeavours
to check the alleged extravagance and corruption of
this command led to his being "invalided out"; after which
he wanders round seeking civilian war-work (and marking
only dishonesty everywhere), and ends up with a post in
the huge, newly-formed and almost entirely farcical Ministry
of Business. This final epithet puts in one word my
criticism of Mr. <span class="sc">O'Donovan's</span> method. Everyone admits the
large grain of truth in his charges; the trouble is that he
has too often allowed an honest indignation to carry him
past his mark into the regions of burlesque, and in particular
to confuse character with caricature. But as a
topical squib, briskly written, <i>How They Did It</i> will provide
plenty of angry amusement, with enough suggestion of
the <i>roman &agrave; clef</i> to keep the curious happy in fitting
originals to its many portraits. I should perhaps add that
the plot, such as it is, is held together by a rather perfunctory
and intermittent love-affair, too obviously employed
only to fill up time while the author is thinking
out some fresh exposure. This I regretted, as <i>Mary</i>, the
heroine, is here a shadow of what seems attractive and
original substance. I wonder that the author did not invent
for her a Ministry of Romance. He is quite capable of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Among the writers who have established stable reputations
for themselves during the War "<span class="sc">Klaxon</span>" is in the
very front rank. This is partly due to an easy natural style,
but most to a sound judgment and an amazingly clear eye
for essentials. To those (not myself) who want to forget the
last few years it may
seem that we have
already been given
enough opportunities
to read about our submarines.
Well, I have
read nearly everything
that has been written on
this subject and could
yet draw great delight
from <i>The Story of Our
Submarines</i> (<span class="sc">Blackwood</span>),
a most informing
and fascinating
book. "Whatever happens,"
says "<span class="sc">Klaxon</span>,"
"the German policy
of torpedoing merchant
ships without warning
must be made not only
illegal but unsafe for a
nation adopting it....
If these notes of mine
serve no other purpose,
they will, at any rate, do something towards differentiating
between the submarine and the U-boat." By which it will be
seen that to his many other claims on our regard "<span class="sc">Klaxon</span>"
adds the gift, not always found among experts, of modesty.</p>
